# About Me


My name is Kelvin Hoover, I am a programmer and cloud architect and have been involved in
designing, developing, and building support for large scale systems.

I own a consulting company specializing in cloud scale transaction and information systems.
This blog, its content, and opinion are all my own.

I strongly believe is experimentation, which comes in many forms such as POC.
I am an early adopter of new technologies especially in programming and system languages.
